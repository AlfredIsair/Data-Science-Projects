## **Diabetes Classification Model**
### **Overview**
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of building a classification model for predicting diabetes based on diagnostic information about patients. The model is trained using a supervised machine learning approach, specifically using logistic regression.

**Dataset:**

**Source**: diabetes.csv - A dataset containing patient information and a binary label for diabetes diagnosis (0: no diabetes, 1: diabetes).
**Features**: Pregnancies, Plasma Glucose, Diastolic Blood Pressure, Triceps Thickness, Serum Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree, Age
## **Steps:**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Dive into the data, understand its characteristics, and identify potential issues like missing values or outliers.

Data Visualization: Explore relationships between features and the target variable (diabetes) using visuals like correlation matrices and boxplots.

Data Splitting: Divide the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets for model training and evaluation.

## **Model Training and Evaluation:**
Data Preprocessing: Normalize numeric features and one-hot encode categorical features.

Model Building: Create a pipeline combining preprocessing and logistic regression.

Training: Train the model on the training data.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

ROC Curve: Visualize the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates at different thresholds for the model.

Model Serialization: Save the trained model as a pickle file for future use.

Classification Report: Analyze detailed metrics for each class (diabetic vs. non-diabetic) to gain insights into precision, recall, and other performance measures.

What you'll find in the notebook:

Detailed explanations of each step in the process.
Code snippets illustrating the implementation.
Visualizations of data relationships and model performance.
Insights into the model's strengths and limitations.
This notebook provides a comprehensive learning experience for anyone interested in building and evaluating machine learning models for medical diagnosis.
