# Data-Science-Projects

This repository contains various projects in the field of data science. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of data analysis and machine learning. Below is a brief overview of the projects available in this repository:

## Customer Churn Prediction
Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction. This project aims to build predictive model to forecast customer churn based on historical data.

## Diabetes Classification
Diabetes is a prevalent health condition worldwide, and early detection is essential for effective management. This project involves building classification model to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various health indicators.

## Heart Stroke Data Analysis
Heart stroke is a severe medical emergency that requires timely intervention. This project involves analyzing data related to heart health to identify factors contributing to the risk of stroke and develop predictive models for early detection.

## Sales Data Analytics
Understanding sales data is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions and optimize their strategies. This project involves analyzing sales data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve sales performance.

## Chronic Disease Analysis
Analyzing the distribution of chronic diseases in US states over a certain period. The project aims to understand the prevalence and distribution of chronic diseases, explore stratification processes used to group patients, and analyze how each state is affected by different diseases or topics.

## E-Commerce Product Delivery Prediction
In this project, we conduct an analysis to understand the factors influencing on-time delivery in e-commerce operations. We explore relationships between various aspects such as product properties, logistics operations, and customer experiences, and their impact on delivery performance. Our aim is to build predictive models using machine learning techniques to forecast delivery timelines accurately.

## NOTE
Each project directory contains the necessary files, including datasets, code scripts, and documentation, to facilitate understanding and reproduction of the analysis. Feel free to explore each project for more details and insights.
